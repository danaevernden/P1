        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h3> In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do. </h3>
            <p> I am a twentysomething, and like most twentysomethings,
                I am trying to find my place in the world. I currently work
                as a business analyst at Liberty Mutual Insurance, where
                I assist in automating monthly reports using Excel VBA and
                mySQL. </p>
          <h3> Why are you taking this course? </h3>
            <p> I am taking this course while in pursuit of a Masters degree from
                Harvard Extension School in Information Management Systems. Out of
                the web principles courses offered, this one sounded like the most
                fun, as well as appropriate for my needs and current experience. </p>
          <h3> What previous experience do you have with programming? </h3>
            <p> I taught myself Excel VBA while working with my previous employer, and I have
                taken courses in web design, JavaScript, and mySQL within the
                last year. Along with taking this course, I am currently
                through lectures for the ever-popular CSCI E-50 course. I am slowly
                realizing that I am more like my father every day, who has been
                a programmer for decades. </p>
          <h3> Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform? </h3>
            <p> I am working on a PC </p>
          <h3> Anything else we should know? </h3>
            <p> I am ready for the challenges this class comes with! </p>
